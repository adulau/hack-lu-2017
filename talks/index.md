Keynotes
========

Queer Privacy & Building Consensual Systems
-------------------------------------------
by Sarah Jamie Lewis

This is a talk about privacy. Unlike many talks on privacy we won't get into state surveillance, PGP or anonymous browsing.

Instead, I'm going to tell you stories. These stories belong to real people. People trying to live their lives, find love, find comfort and
find happiness in a world that, at best, pretends they don't exist, and at worst, punishes them for existing.

These stories are from people who need privacy and security, but who are failed by our current tool, systems and communities.

Not all of these stories have happy endings, but each one shines a light that can show us how to build tools, systems and communities that
are more useful, more inclusive and safer for those who are marginalized by society.

Information Flows and Leaks in Social Media
-------------------------------------------
by Vladimir Kropotov and Fyodor Yarochkin

Covfefe or not covfefe? The social network is a very powerful tool of
influence in modern world. Is your opinion really yours? With this
presentation we examine a number of social events and the impact they
had on social media platforms. We try to understand the dynamics of
information dissemination through a social network and demonstrate how
these networks are frequently abused by all sorts of malfactors to
pursue an agenda of their interest. Our findings are presented in form
of several case studies where we walk through series of major events
and analyze how these events were played online. Different regional
groups, different linguistic groups: the behavior on social media
could be a pre-requisite of activity in kinetic world. Known campaigns
of character assassination online were in some cases followed by
physical extermination or attacks on the objects of attention. We
examine such behaviours in different national context: Latin America,
Russia, China, Ukraine and the Middle East and demonstrate the
affiliation of these activities with other Black Market commodities
and services. Further, we discuss how these services could be abused to
have a major impact in physical world.

Talks
=====

On Strategy
-----------
by Eleanor Saitta

How should small development teams think about security?

Dedicated security hires often come fairly late in a startup's life. As a consultant,
I often see teams of up to fifty engineers with no security staff.
Even if they're motivated to build secure systems and consider security a collective responsibility,
their understanding often doesn't go much beyond patching boxes and one-off fixes for basic,
OWASP-level issues.  Even larger organizations in the 300-400 engineer range often don't have
a unified security strategy to coordinate the what security staff they do have.
Lack of understanding, strategy, and coordination yields poor execution.

In this talk, I'll go over my toolkit for working with development teams
who are ready to get serious about security.  Whether you're an
engineering director trying to figure out where to turn, the first
security hire at a startup, or a consultant looking at it from the other
side, this should help you see where to start.  We'll cover:

* Why you want to start with some technical work but not too much
* How to teach teams to see security in a way that enables them to manage it as a whole-systems outcome
* The scope of work teams should be looking at
* How to think about risk and cost usefully
* The relationship security should have with the rest of the organization and the business
* How to deal with security compliance and still be secure
* How to plan for security staffing and when to work with consultants

Intel AMT: Using & Abusing the Ghost in the Machine
---------------------------------------------------
by Parth Shukla

<!-- 45min + questions -->

Come see how Intel AMT can be used to completely own a modern machine permanently
and without detection.

In the first half of the talk, we‚Äôll see how an attacker can abuse the legitimate
functionalities of Intel AMT to gain long term persistent access with little to no
chance of detection. The demoed attack can be executed to take ownership of AMT in
less than 60 seconds - either through supply chain or temporary physical access.
We will then show how AMT can be used for persistent access to the machine via
readily available and easy-to-use C&C tools. Finally, we will cover possible mitigations
and preventions against such attacks.

In the second half of the talk, we will walk through the process of doing non-destructive
forensics on an Intel AMT to which we don‚Äôt know the admin password (i.e. potentially
attacker controlled!). We will also describe how to reclaim ownership of the AMT once
forensics is complete. Finally, we will be releasing the Linux tooling we developed in
order to facilitate AMT forensics.

*What is Intel AMT?*

Intel AMT is an out-of-band, always-on management technology, embedded into Intel
chipsets supporting vPro technology, intended to allow remote management of equipment
without the need for a functioning OS. Intel AMT is commonly available on all Intel-based
business laptops & desktops as well as many high end consumer laptops & desktops.

Countering Security Threats by Sharing Information: Emerging Civil Society Practices
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
by Becky Kazansky

What role does threat information sharing play in the safety and security of civil
society organizations? This talk takes the audience through a case study on information
sharing practices based on interviews with 20 human rights defenders dealing with a set of
serious digital and physical security threats.

The case study presented in this talk explains how a network of civil society organizations
focused on advancing women‚Äôs rights in a politically volatile context built up their security
infrastructure by starting to share information about threats with their network of allies. The
talk will walk the audience through how the network of human rights defenders began to build trust
and log security incidents, and to eventually spot patterns that allowed them to put effective security
countermeasures into place.

Controversially, this network of human rights defenders relied on Facebook as their
platform for information sharing about threats, a fact which brings up many important
questions about the merits and pitfalls of using commercial platforms, effective threat modeling,
and generally, what it takes to get people to move to more secure modes of information management.
This talk will show that sharing information about threats strengthened the work of this human rights
network even as it exposed them to further dangers, and came at great cost in terms of time and resources.
What lessons can be gleaned from their experience?

This talk aims to offer rich insights into how ‚Äôreal-world‚Äô security practices play out in
organizational contexts, as made possible through the kind of ‚Äòlongitudinal‚Äô, ethnographic study
done by the speaker. The case study is based on interviews, observations, and discussions taking
place around the context of a digital security workshop conducted by the speaker two years ago,
while working together with the Tactical Technology Collective. It is the hope of the speaker
that highlighting the actual practices of people with ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô constraints can offer the
security community a chance to think about how to create systems and infrastructures that
build on existing practices rather than providing ill-fitting add-ons.

Lead Programme Researcher at Tactical Technology Collective.

Digital Vengeance: Exploiting Notorious C&C Toolkits
----------------------------------------------------
by Waylon Grange

Every year thousands of organizations are compromised by targeted attacks.
In many cases, the attacks are labeled as advanced and persistent which suggests a
high level of sophistication in the attack and tools used. Many times, this title is
leveraged as an excuse that the events were inevitable or irresistible as if the assailants‚Äô
skill set is well beyond what defenders are capable of. To the contrary, often these assailants
are not as untouchable as many would believe.

If one looks at the many APT reports that have been released over the years some clear
patterns start to emerge. A small number of Remote Administration Tools are preferred by
actors and reused across multiple campaigns. Frequently sited tools include Gh0st RAT, Plug-X, and
XtremeRAT among others. Upon examination, the command and control components of these notorious RATs
are riddled with vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to turn the tables from hunter to hunted.

Although the material in this talk will provide tools for launching an offensive against
attackers this talk is not intended to be instructional for hacking back. The ethics and
legality of counter attacks will be touched on only briefly as that is a discussion beyond the
scope of this talk.

The presentation will disclose several exploits that could allow remote execution or remote
information disclosure on computers running these well-known C&C components. It should serve as a
warning to those actors who utilize such tool sets. That is to say, such actors live in glass houses and
should stop throwing stones.

Keynterceptor: Press any key to continue
----------------------------------------
by Niels van Dijkhuizen

The past decade has taught us that there are quite some attacks vectors on USB.
These vary from hardware key-logging to driver fuzzing and from power surge
injection to network traffic re-routing. In addition to addressing these issues, the
security community has also tried to fix some of these. Several defensive hard- and software
tools focus on a particular piece of the puzzle. However none, is able to completely mitigate the
risks that involves the everyday use of USB in our lives.

Key stroke injectors like Rubber Ducky and MalDuino have a big disadvantage: they are not very stealthy. When no protection
is in place, there is a big change the end-user will notice something fishy is going on. Proper
USB Class filtering policies and a daemon that monitors typing speed will put this kind of
attacks to a halt. To bypass both the user's attention and current security mechanisms, I have
developed Keynterceptor. This is a proof of concept keyboard implant that is able to capture and
inject keystrokes and communicate over the air via a back-channel while keeping the local time.

Since Keynterceptor is made up from very affordable, off-the-shelf electronic parts, it is
likely that such an attack tool can be created and used by someone with few resources.

I will demonstrate the effectiveness of Keynterceptor in a real-world scenario where an end-point gets compromised.

A view into ALPC-RPC
--------------------
by Clement Rouault and Thomas Imbert


The Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) is an Inter-Process Communication method widely used in recent Windows version.
One important application of the ALPC is to perform Remote Procedure Call (RPC) on the local computer.
Whereas ALPC have been scrutinized by security researcher in the last few years, its usage in the MS-RPC have been less documented.

This presentation will explain what are the core structures & API of ALPC then explore how RPC-over-ALPC works.
Furthermore we will describe how we searched for vulnerabilities using a full-Python implementation of a simple RPC client soon to be released.
Lastly, an UAC bypass and a Local Privilege Escalation found during our research will be presented.

How I‚Äôve Broken Every Threat Intel Platform I‚Äôve Ever Had (And Settled on MISP)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
by John Bambenek

Almost every major enterprise has the same problem, how to categorize, store, and operationalize the
various sources of intelligence (internal and external) so that they can be useful. The way we categorize
information and operationalize information, however, has led to design flaws of almost every Intel
platform out there. IP address lists are good for plugging into firewalls, but they don‚Äôt appear
organically in the absence of other critical information like hostnames, file names, TLS certificates, and so on.

To perform proper intelligence, all of these items need to be correlated into common events so
discrete data points can be mapped to larger events and to overall patterns and campaigns against
an organization.

This talk covers the adventures of working with various platforms to store a large malware
configuration database so that it can retain its usefulness to users to correlate attacks
back to specific actors. This malware configuration database (called Barncat) ultimately
sits on MISP after attempting other platforms that failed to work for this use case. The
intent of this talk is to shift the paradigm from indicators to events as the starting
element to begin threat intelligence work as the relationship of all the observables of an
attack are important to retain, analyze, and correlate.

Let‚Äôs Play with WinDBG & .NET
-----------------------------
by Paul Rascagneres

.NET is an increasingly important component of the Microsoft ecosystem providing a
shared framework. Many Microsoft tools, such as PowerShell, rely on the .NET platform for
their functionality. Obviously, this makes .NET an enticing language for malware developers too.
Hence, malware researchers must also be familiar with the language and have the necessary skills to
analyse malicious software that runs on the platform. During the presentation, I will explain how to
automate .NET analysis with WinDBG the Microsoft debugger. To illustrate my talk, I will show how to
analyse PowerShell scripts with WinDBG and how to automatically unpack a .NET packer family discovered
recently. The presentation includes several live demo on WinDBG usage in this specific context.

analysis, malware hunting and more specially on Advanced Persistence Threat campaigns and rootkit
capabilities. He previously worked for several incident response team within the private and public sectors.

Sigma - Generic Signatures for Log Events
-----------------------------------------
by Thomas Patzke

Log files are a great resource for hunting threats and analysis of incidents. Unfortunately,
there is no standardized signature format like YARA for files or Snort signatures for
network traffic. This makes sharing of log signatures by security researchers and software
developers problematic. Further, most SIEM systems have their own query language,
which makes signature distribution in large heterogeneous environments inefficient
and increases costs for replacement of SIEM solutions.

Sigma tries to fill these gaps by providing a YAML-based format for log signatures,
an open repository of signatures and an extensible tool that converts Sigma signatures
into different query languages. Rules and tools were released as open source and are
actively developed. This presentation gives an overview about use cases, Sigma rules
and the conversion tool, the development community and future plans of the project.

Bio: Thomas Patzke

Malicious use of Microsoft "Local Administrator Password Solution"
------------------------------------------------------------------
by Maxime Clementz & Antoine Goichot

<!-- Tuesday or Wednesday-->

"Local Administrator Password Solution", known as LAPS, provides management of
local account passwords of domain joined computers. Passwords are stored in Active
Directory (AD) and protected by ACL, so only eligible users can read it or request its reset.

We started some security research on this solution and managed to get illegitimate
access to local administrator credentials (and to control the generation of a new
administrator password) in a post-exploitation scenario (to maintain presence on a
compromised computer). Moreover, depending on the method used to deploy LAPS, we also
elaborated a privilege escalation scenario.

Both scenarios will be demonstrated on stage, we will explain the inner working of
LAPS and our exchanges with the Microsoft Security Response Center.

Device sensors meet the web - a story of sadness and regret
-----------------------------------------------------------
by Lukasz Olejnik

The web is becoming increasingly rich in features as more powerful APIs are introduced and
implemented by browsers. Among the new features are communication channels such as Web
Bluetooth as well as access to device sensors (light, proximity, magnetic field, etc.)
allowing access to information about users and their surroundings. New web features offer
increased functionality and novel use patterns, but also increase the risk of abuses. In this
talk we will discuss and demonstrate the privacy risks associated with exposing sensors to the
web and how sensors could be abused by malicious websites. We‚Äôll show the risk of abusing of
seemingly innocuous sensor information; we‚Äôll describe how Battery Status API enabled tracking and
information leaks, and show how to steal web browsing history using the ambient light sensor. At the
end we will take a step back and highlight the need to consider security and privacy during the
drafting of new standards, as well as discuss how to improve the big picture for web users.

The Bicho: An Advanced Car Backdoor Maker
-----------------------------------------
by Sheila Ayelen Berta and Claudio Caracciolo

Attacks targeting connected cars have already been presented in several conferences,
as well as different tools to spy on CAN buses. However, there have been only a few
attempts to create something similar to a useful backdoor for the CAN bus. Moreover,
some of those proofs of concept were built upon Bluetooth technology, limiting the attack
range and therefore tampering its effects.

Those things are old! Throughout our research we have successfully developed a hardware
backdoor for the CAN bus, called "The Bicho". Its powerful capabilities render it a very smart
backdoor. Have you ever imagined the possibility of your car being automatically attacked based on its
GPS coordinates, its current speed or any other set of parameters? The Bicho makes it all possible.

All the "magic" is in the assembler-coded firmware we developed for a PIC18F2685 microcontroller.
Additionally our hardware backdoor has an intuitive graphical interface, called "Car Backdoor Maker",
which is open-sourced and allows payload customization. The Bicho supports multiple attack payloads and
it can be used against any vehicle that supports CAN, without limitations regarding manufacturer or model.
Each one of the payloads is associated to a command that can be delivered via SMS, allowing remote execution
from any geographical point.

Furthermore, as an advanced feature, the attack payload can be configured to be automatically
executed once the victim's vehicle is proximate to a given GPS location. The execution can also be
triggered by detecting the transmission of a particular CAN frame, which can be associated with the
speed of the vehicle, its fuel level, and some other factors, providing the means to design highly
sophisticated attacks and execute them remotely.

Are your VoLTE and VoWiFi calls secure?
---------------------------------------
by Sreepriya Chalakkal

Voice over LTE (VoLTE) as well as Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) are variants of Voice over IP
that makes use of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) in its backend. In this talk, we identify
five different attacks on VoLTE/VoWiFi.

This includes mainly (i)sniffing VoLTE/VoWiFi interfaces, (ii)extracting IPSec keys from IP
Multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIM) that is embedded within the SIM card, and (iii)performing
three different kinds of injection attacks in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) headers that are used for
signaling of VoLTE/VoWiFi. As a result of VoLTE/VoWiFi sniffing, we identified information disclosures
such as leaking IMSI, IMEI, location of users and private IP of IMS.

We also managed to extract the ciphering key and the integrity key (CK/IK) used for IPSec from
ISIM with the help of a hardware device called SIMTrace.

We also discuss three different SIP header injection attacks that enables location
manipulation and side channel attacks.

It is important to note here that all these attacks are valid on the current 3GPP standards
that are used by telecom providers. Thus understanding the attacks and mitigating them is of high relevance.

This is a continuation of the work presented by Schmidt et.al in the talk IMSecure ‚Äì
Attacking VoLTE at Areas41 conference, 2016. There is also a [reference paper for more information](https://www.ernw.de/download/newsletter/ERNW_Whitepaper_60_Practical_Attacks_On_VoLTE_And_VoWiFi_v1.0.pdf)

Snuffleupagus - Killing bugclasses in PHP 7, virtual-patching the rest
---------------------------------------------------------------------
by S√©bastien (blotus) Blot, Thibault (buixor) Koechlin & Julien (jvoisin) Voisin

Suhosin is a great PHP module, but unfortunately, it's getting old, new ways have been found
to compromise PHP applications, and some aren't working anymore; and it doesn't play well with the
shiny new PHP 7. As a secure web-hosting company, we needed a reliable and future-proof
solution to address the flow of new vulnerabilities that are published every day.
This is why we developed Snuffleupagus, a new (and open-source!) PHP security module, that
provides several features that we needed: passively killing several PHP-specific bug classes,
but also implementing virtual-patching at the PHP level, allowing to patch vulnerabilities
in a precise, false-positive-free, ultra-low overhead way, without even touching the applications' code.

Reverse Engineering  a (M)MORPG
-------------------------------
by Antonin Beaujeant

<!-- 4 or 6 or 8 hours -->

<!-- Other notes:
Ideally, I would like to set up a game environment locally so the audience can play, reverse, inject along with me.
For this, I would need a server that can run the game.
Can this be provided by Hack.lu?

I guess I'm asking a lot, but would that be possible to have two beamers?
One for the game/hack and the other for the slides?
If not, one should be enough, but I will just need to switch between screen and laptop often.

-->

This workshop will cover the basics of reverse engineering a (M)MORPG. The
target will be Pwn Adventure 3, a MMORPG developed by Vector35 for the Ghost in the
Shellcode 2015 CTF. Despite being old and intentionally vulnerable, the technique and
methodology used should not differ from reality. We will first have a closer look at the
network communication between the client and the game server and dissect the custom binary
protocol used. For this, the instructor will explain a methodology that consist of isolating
data, analyse the changes and raise assumptions. Once the protocol partly reversed, we will
build a Wireshark parser (dissector) in order to start analysing the protocol itself. For
further tests, we will create an asynchronous proxy for intercepting the network traffic in
order to successfully modify and/or inject packets. In the next part of the workshop, we will
reverse engineer the client/server logic in order to highlight "secrets" to finish a few
quests and identify vulnerabilities in the game. We will also patch the binary to become a
Superman (running faster, jumping higher). Finally, we will hook the DLL in order to hack the
game "on the fly".

Malware Triage Workshop - Malscripts Are The New Exploit Kit
------------------------------------------------------------
by Sean Wilson and Sergei Frankoff

<!-- 4 hours, 2h is doable but sub optimal-->

Traditionally malware triage has focused on exploit kits which were the initial
infection vector of choice, but this is changing. In recent years malscripts and
file based exploits have become an equally common initial infection vector. Often
delivered via email, malscripts can take many different forms, WScript, Javascript, or
embedded macros. However, the goal is always the same; obtain code execution and deliver a
malicious payload.

In this workshop you will work through the triage of a live malscript sample. During this
process you will identify and extract malscripts from Office documents, manually deobfuscate the
malscripts, circumvent anti-analysis techniques, and finally determine the purpose of the scripts and
payload in order to develop countermeasures.

This workshop is aimed at junior incident responders, hobby malware analysts, and general
security or IT practitioners. If you have a good understanding of scripting languages like
VBScript, and Javascript, and you are familiar with windows internals you should have no
problem completing the workshop. We request that you come prepare with a laptop that you are
able to use to analyze malware. We strongly recommend installing a Virtual Machine. If you
would like to install a temporary Windows 10 virtual machine you can [obtain a free copy](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines).
We also recommend you have Python 2.7 installed on your laptop, you can [obtain a copy](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/).

Getting the Most Out of Windows Event Logs
------------------------------------------
by David Szili

<!-- 4 hours -->

A typical mistake repeatedly made by many security teams is that they collect such
large amount of events that at the end, their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
solution chokes on the data fed into it, rendering it slow and ineffective. "Collect all the events!!!"
sounds nice in theory, but in practice, less is often more and we must select and focus on events that
provide real value from a security perspective and have an actual use-case behind them. But what if we do
not even have a SIEM and cannot afford one or do not have the staff or the skill to deploy and maintain one?
Luckily, in a Microsoft Windows environment we have built-in and free tools at our disposal to get quickly
started with security monitoring and hunting using Windows Event Logs.

In this workshop, we will go through some of the most important and valuable Windows Events to be
collected such as AppLocker or EMET events, user and service creation events, PowerShell commands, etc.
We will discuss how to properly configure Advanced Audit Policy Settings, see how to collect events with
Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) and how to set up Sysmon for advanced application and process monitoring.

Once we have the list of events we need, we will see a few simple PowerShell commands and modules that
can help us slice and dice Event Logs like Get-WinEvent. We will also test scripts and tools that are
made for monitoring and detection, such as DeepBlueCLI. Finally, we will use the free Power BI Desktop to
build nice dashboards to give us a better overview of the data we are collecting.
